# MyMediaLib
The aim of the project is to import media files (all sorts of images, RAW images, Apple LivePhotos and all sorts of video) from various devices (phones, tablets, cameras) and store it on your local server.
It includes REAST API (DjangoRest) and AngularJS client to navigate over your files through the browser.
